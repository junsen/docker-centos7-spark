Launching spark
--------------------
## docker-centos-spark
A Dockerfile that produces a Centos-based Docker image that will run a standalone pre-build version of ApacheSpark.

## Image Creation
This example creates the image with the tag internavenue/centos-spark, but you can change this to use your own username.

$ docker build -t="internavenue/centos-spark" .
Alternately, you can run the following if you have GNU Make installed...

$ make
You can also specify a custom docker username like so:

$ make DOCKER_USER=internavenue
Usage
Standalone single-node use
sudo docker run -t -i -p internavenue/centos-spark:centos7
Spark is by default placed at /opt/spark

You can run a test (estimate Pi number) with the following command within the container

/opt/spark/bin/run-example SparkPi 10
Standalone cluster mode
Spin-up the master container
sudo sh start-master.sh
Spin-up workers:
sudo sh start-worker.sh
To launch a Spark shell against the master:
sudo sh spark-shell.sh
